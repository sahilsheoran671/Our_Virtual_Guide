# India Must See Places-Map App React Project
I am going to develop a single page application (accessibble and available offline) featuring a map with extra functionality added to this map (including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content).

I will use React.js with Google Maps API, Flickr API, MediaWiki API (Wikipedia), as well as react-google-maps and escape-string-regexp packages to build this project.

My app will presents a map of places worth visiting in India. User can filter locations by name and click each marker to display info window to get a detailed information about specific location with pictures.
